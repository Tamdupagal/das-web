      <h2 className="sub-heading"> Introduction</h2>
      <p style={{paddingTop:'1rem',}} className="description">
      This post is for you if you&apos;ve been thinking about building your first game but don&apos;t know where or how to begin. We&apos;ve gathered a collection of tips and tricks from other developers who have progressed from hobbyists to professional game developers. Following these steps will help you to succeed with your first game.
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-heading">Think of a unique idea.</h2>
      <p style={{paddingTop:'1rem',}} className="description">
      You must be willing to think outside the box. Your game will not succeed if you copy someone else&pos;s idea and give it a different name. If you are unwilling to take chances, your project will fail. The best way to do this is by developing something unique.
      Think about what other games have done before yours. What makes them unique? How does their gameplay work? If their gameplay is similar enough to yours (or worse yet—borrowed from someone else), then consider changing some things about it
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-heading">Write your ideas down.</h2>
      <p style={{paddingTop:'1rem',}} className="description">
      Writing your ideas down is an important step in the process of developing your first game. It helps you to organize your thoughts and allows you to see how they connect.
      Write down as much information as possible about what it is about and why others need to know about it. The more detail, the better!
      Write in a simple style that makes sense for where you are in the process (i.e., no fancy words or big blocks). If something seems too long-winded, write short sentences instead of paragraphs—this will help keep things moving faster!
      </p>
      <h2 className="sub-heading">Create a storyline. Your storyline will act as the foundation of your game.</h2>
      <p style={{paddingTop:'1rem',}} className="description">
      Your storyline will act as the foundation of your game. Before starting development, You must ensure that you have a strong story. A good story should be interesting, engaging for players, and also relatable to them—so it must be easy for people who don&apos;t play games every day (like non-gamers) to understand what&apos; going on.
You can use an existing plot from popular media or create something original from scratch if needed!
</p>
<h2 className="sub-heading">Make sure your instructions are clear.</h2>
<p style={{paddingTop:'1rem',}} className="description">
Make sure your instructions are clear.
Everyone has different learning styles, so you should try to make it easy for them to understand what they need to do to play the game. It can be helpful to include diagrams or images that show players how their characters move around the board and interact with each other, as well as how they can score points by completing objectives (such as collecting all of the treasure or defeating all of the enemies). If someone needs more help than this provides, maybe they will ask another player who knows more about how things work: this way, everyone can learn together!

</p>
<h2 className="sub-heading">Create characters that are relatable and interesting.</h2>
<p style={{paddingTop:'1rem',}} className="description">
The most important part of character creation is that they should be relatable. Character traits and traits that make your characters unique don&pos;t matter if the audience can&pos;t relate to them. If you&pos;re looking for examples of great game characters, look no further than Super Mario Bros., Sonic the Hedgehog, Link from The Legend of Zelda series, and Donkey Kong (he&pos;s an ape).
When creating a new character in your game, ask yourself: Do I like this person? Why do I like them? What makes it so special? If a character isn&pos;t relatable or interesting, then there&pos;s no point in making it into one. Because nobody will want to play as them after seeing how awkward they look on the screen with their teeth pointing out at strange angles and their hair standing straight up like someone just came through there with a spray bottle full off hairspray trying to fix their frizz problem.

</p>
<h2 className="sub-heading">Have the main character that can relate to the audience.</h2>
<p style={{paddingTop:'1rem',}} className="description">
It is important to have a main character that can relate to the audience. The best way to do this is by ensuring your main character is interesting, relatable and someone people want to play or be.
What&pos;s the best way to do this? Your game should have an engaging plot and a relatable protagonist with whom gamers of all ages (and genders) can identify.

</p>
<h2 className="sub-heading">Find the right music to complement each scene in your game.</h2>
<p style={{paddingTop:'1rem',}} className="description">
Music can be an essential part of the game experience. It&pos;s one of the most important elements in creating a memorable experience for players. While music can&pos;t replace gameplay or storytelling, it can help set the mood for each scene and convey emotions that you want to evoke in your audience.
When choosing music for your game:

</p>
<div className='list'>
<li>Choose songs that match up with what&pos;s happening in the scene (e.g., if there&pos;s a chase sequence, use adrenaline-pumping pop music).</li>
<li>Try to find some songs with similar sounds or themes so they&pos;ll feel more cohesive with each other—this will make them easier to integrate into the gameplay as well!</li>
</div>
<h2 className="sub-heading">Make sure your game is easy to play and understand.</h2>
<div className='list'>
<li>Make sure your game is fun and easy to play.</li>
<li>Make sure the game isn&pos;t too hard or too easy.</li>
<li>Make sure the game isn&pos;t too short or long.</li>
<li>Make sure the game doesn&pos;t have any special rules that would make it difficult for a player to understand what&pos;s going on in each level (for example, if you&pos;re playing and your mouse is stuck in the middle of an obstacle course).</li>
</div>
<h2 className="sub-heading">Ensure that you have enough content in your game before releasing it to the public.</h2>
<p style={{paddingTop:'1rem',}} className="description">
You must have enough content before releasing your game. The evaluation of your game will depend on how much it offers to the players, so you must make sure they can access all of the information they need and learn from your game.
For example, if you&pos;re making a dating simulator. Then the player should be able to go on dates with multiple characters from the beginning. If there are any issues during these dates (for example, someone doesn&pos;t like another character), make sure there is an explanation for why this happened and how it could happen again later in their lives, as well as what other options might exist beyond those two instances (e.g., meeting new people).

</p>
<h2 className="sub-heading">Don&pos;t rush the development process. Take your time and enjoy creating your masterpiece!</h2>
<p style={{paddingTop:'1rem',}} className="description">
Rushing the development process can be disastrous for your game. Take your time, don&pos;t be afraid to take a break if you&pos;re feeling overwhelmed, and don&pos;t forget to enjoy the process! Maintain your effort to ensure that everything looks and feels fantastic when the time comes to launch.

Making your first game is intimidating, but with these tips, you&pos;re bound for success!
</p>
<div className='list'>
<li>Don&pos;t be intimidated. You can do it! If you&pos;ve got a good idea and the skills to create it, then this is an opportunity for growth. The most important thing is to be confident in yourself—don&pos;t let anyone else&pos;s opinion influence yours (even if they are people who worked on games before).</li>
<li>Set goals, and don&pos;t give up. It&pos;s easy to get discouraged by setbacks or other obstacles along the way—but try not to let that stop you from reaching your goal! If something doesn&pos;t go as planned at first glance (like losing all of your progress), don&pos;t give up. Figure out how best to handle those situations so they won&pos;t happen again later down the line when building something new again later on down the road after creating several successful titles over time.</li>
